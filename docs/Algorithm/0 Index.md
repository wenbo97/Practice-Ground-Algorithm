# Blueprint Step by Step Algorithm Lean Roadmap

**The idea is:**
- Start from physical storage (linear structures)
- Move to logical organization (non-linear structures)
- Then focus on searching and traversal - thinking patterns.
- Finally move to the extremely efficiency - dynamic programming and advanced algorithms

### Linear Structure
- Array
- Two pointers
- Sort algorithms
	- Check `merge sort` and `quick sort` at first
- Linked array
